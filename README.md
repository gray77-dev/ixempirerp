# IX : EmpireRP

Helix EmpireRP gamemode, based on Helix. Created for a more serious roleplay and to fully control the players and add a realistic ambience in their game. 
The factions are based off classic StarWarsRP EmpireRP mode based on DarkRP.
This version is in french, made for my server, you can ask me to translate it or translate it by yourself. (Translate is not a good alternative, ask me instead if you are not a bilingual)
Thanks to impulse and the guys for all the work they have made on Helix, and thanks to the helix community for helping me on the problems that i went through by creating this schema.
